## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Write Scene (Primary) — COMPLETE
```
/write-scene → decomposeChapter [P1] → queryExemplars [P1] → assembleTieredContext [P1]
  → scene-drafter [P2] → assembleScenes [P2] → analyzeChapter [P2+P3]
  → executeDirective [P2] → revision loop → output
```

### Flow 2: Quality Analysis — COMPLETE
```
analyzeChapter → filter words + sensory + rhythm [P2]
  + detectBannedExpressions [P3] + detectViolationsSimple [P3] + assessTexturePresence [P3]
  → SurgicalDirective[] → executeDirective with MODEL_ROUTING [P2+P3+P4]
```

### Flow 3: Self-Improvement — WIRED (not invoked)
```
extractCandidates → getParagraphs [P2] → computeStylometrics [P1]
  → combinedScore filter → classifyExemplar [P1] → isDuplicate
  → promoteCandidates → addExemplar [P1]
  → recordSnapshot → detectRegression [EWMA + z-score]
```

## Tech Debt

### Phase 3: Korean Specialization
- `src/korean/` has no `index.ts` barrel export (direct imports work, architectural inconsistency)

### Phase 4: Advanced Quality
- Missing `04-VERIFICATION.md` (all 3 plan SUMMARYs have must-haves checked, plans are verified but no formal verification report)
- `runMultiStageRevision` is exported and tested (26 tests) but not invoked by any skill — the 4-stage progressive improvement strategy is available but unused

### Phase 5: Self-Improvement
- `extractCandidates`, `promoteCandidates`, `recordSnapshot`, `detectRegression` are exported and tested (58 tests) but not invoked by any skill — the self-improvement loop is wired but not activated

### Pre-existing
- `arc.template.json` and `hook.template.json` have no matching schemas

## Verdict

**Status: TECH_DEBT** — All 18 requirements are satisfied. No critical blockers. The accumulated tech debt consists of exported-but-unused features (Phase 4 multi-stage revision orchestration, Phase 5 self-improvement invocation) that are fully implemented, tested, and wired but awaiting skill-level integration. These can be addressed in v5.1 or accepted as backlog.
